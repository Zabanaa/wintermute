# Wintermute

## The Why

I love cyberpunk. I love API design (really, I do) and I wanted to practice my
NodeJS skills. So what better way to bring these three things together than
using expressJS to build an API of famous cyberpunk novels, characters and
authors ?

The goal was to develop a clean API available to developers to test their
applications with. I am fully aware that there are a million of them out there
already, but let's be honest, no one cares about Lorem Ipsum.

# The What

Here's a quick list of wintermute's features:

- Support for GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE requests
- Built with the best practices of REST in mind
- Simple, clean and easy to understand API
- Support for HasMany relationships
- Uses PostgreSQL for the database
- No need to register (for now)
- Support for nested resources
- Compatible with the most popular JS frameworks
- Secured with SSL
- Graceful error handling

# The How

You can check out some examples of how to use the API [0](here).

# The things to know about contributing

I will be more than happy to accept contributions to this project, especially if you can
teach me a trick of two about API design and security.

So feel free to initiate a PR and I will look into it :smile: (The only thing that I
require is that you give an explanation as to how your solution is better/improves
security etc)

# The things that remain to be done

- [ ] Write a detailed documentation
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Implement pagination
- [ ] Implement caching
- [ ] Add support for OPTIONS requests
- [ ] Create better (cleaner) tests
- [ ] Extract (when possible) controller logic to their own functions (to help with unit
  testing)

# The things I learned

- Express JS
- The Sequelize ORM
- How to create roles and manage a postgres installation
- How to dynamically set environment variables using the infamous `package.json` file
- How to merge and clone objects using `Object.assign`
- ES6 Destructuring of objects
- Compare equality of arrays
